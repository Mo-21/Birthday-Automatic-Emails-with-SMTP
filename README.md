# Birthday Automatic Emails with SMTP

This project uses built in python lib SMTP to send emails from two parties. It 
uses pandas to get the hard-written birthdays and months, and then tries matching
them with today's date.

The project can also be hosted in `https://www.pythonanywhere.com/` to schedule it for daily run.
